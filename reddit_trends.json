The only issue I noticed when seeing the house is the basement. Once I went downstairs, you can tell a musty type smell like higher humidity. They do have a dehumidifier going as well. There were two main floor joists on the ceiling, and they where being held up/given extra support by floor jacks, going directly from the cement floor to the joists above. There were about 6 floor jacks for each joists. I did see a sump pit with a pump on the floor. Otherwise not too much else, did notice any standing water or anything while I was in there. I asked my agent about the disclosure form and the sellers did put that \"the basement has water seapage on the floor during heavy rainfall\". \nIs this house worth continuing with an offer etc? I know an older home like this won't be perfect, and it's a larger property that's hard to find for it's price. But I don't want to get myself into a mess.",
